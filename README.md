## How It's Made:
Full-stack CRUD application that adopts MVC architecture with a tech stack of JavaScript, EJS, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose. Users are able to create accounts and login with authentication via Passport. Users can upload images via Multer that are then stored on Cloudinary for optimization. Users have their own profiles with their own uploads but they can also browse the 'doodlebook' this is where all uploads are displayed. Users can browse through the doodlebook and like and make comments on other images.  



## Optimizations
Further optimizations include being able to add doodles to inpsiration board (like a favorites), be able to follow each other and display number of followers (maybe a different word for this though), have a board for themed challenges for doodles.



## Lessons Learned:
- [x] Cloudinary and Multer
- [x] More comfortable with MVC architecture
- [x] EJS partials and SSR
